#GitHub View modes

GitHub is all about comparing versions right? So why not make comparing images more awesome? GitHub now has view modes for image diffs.

* __Two Up:__ Lets you see your versions side by side, and shows you any changes in image dimensions.
* __Swipe:__ Allows you to see edge to edge changes making it easy to detect minute color shifts.
* __Onion Skin:__ Allows you to see through your versions, making subtle alignment shifts easier to spot.
* __Difference:__ Lets you quickly see which pixels in a image have changed between versions.

To see it in action, check out [the demo](https://github.com/cameronmcefee/Image-Diff-View-Modes/commit/8e95f70c9c47168305970e91021072673d7cdad8)

In order to use this project, I think it is nice to have Photoshop installed.
